If you want to achieve makeup looks such as girly, have no-makeup or shine bright like a diamond, all the seasons’ offer these basic variants and you can achieve it by the products you already have. The makeup trends are divided into the following seasons: summer, spring, fall, and winter.

Seasonal makeup trends:

1.	Summer- The makeup artist in Panchkula recommends going all pink and glowy in the summers. Summer is the time when you are naturally tan and hence lay off the contour and bronzer. The summer has unbearable heat but with it comes the best lighting ever- sunlight. If you want to glow like a goddess, then apply highlighters everywhere. Apply body highlighters in the form of serums, oils and glitter powders. For better and more glowing cheeks, apply two highlighters, i.e. liquid highlighter followed by the powdered highlight. This will truly make your natural tan glow. Finish the look with a bright and cheery pink or red lipstick.

2.	Spring- Spring is the season of colors and floral which is why you need to go all out with colors. Get your colorful gel liners out and create some experimental looks with it. The spring will have you gravitate towards lipsticks in the shade of the purple, violets and plums. The most spring lipstick color is the wine shade.

3.	Fall- Fall is the start of the cold and the time when we aren't as bronzed and tan as summer. Fall is the season to lay off the highlight and apply lots of bronzing powder and contouring. This will enable you to have a healthy tan even in the winter. The fall makeup is mostly the no-makeup look with a deep brown lipstick. The fall makeup focuses more on the bronzing and lip than any other aspect. You don't require blush as well since your cheeks will be automatically red.

4.	Winter- For winter makeup looks, your base is crucial. Your skin is dry and stretchy and this will create a problem for makeup. Make sure you are moisturizing enough to prepare your skin for the winter makeup routine. Winter is the time to bring on the face oils and have a natural and glowing skin. Go crazy with a blush as it will help you look adorable in the winter. The look is kept very casual with most focus on the base and blush. The e-girl makeup look is ideal.


There aren’t any strict rules in following a set of parameters for applying makeup. You can opt for any makeup routine in any season. These guidelines by the makeup artist in Panchkula is only given so that you can look your best and create new looks every season.
